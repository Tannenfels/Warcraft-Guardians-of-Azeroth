mystery_of_the_makers_DESC;Учение Титанов - металлических гигантов, путешествующих по космосу, наводя порядок в мирах, широко распространена в обществе дворфов. Практический характер карликов не позволяет им слепо верить в расу прародителей. Они полагаются на измерение, математику и свои собственные усилия. Вместо принятия существования своих создателей на веру, дворфы приступили к масштабному исследованию своего прошлого.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cult_of_the_candle_DESC;Who would have thought that even such a simple thing as a candle could become a symbol of faith? Kobolds that dwell in underground tunnels and spend their lives mining, primarily for gold, are sure that the candle is wise. And this is not surprising, because in the condition of darkness it is the candle that helps the kobolds to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cult_of_strength;Культ Силы;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orcish_fel_DESC;Whether its power is found through contracts between warlocks and demonic lords or through the blood of a certain Annihilan, fel threatens to corrupt completely and absolutely. Though famous for its fel-fueled crusade, the Burning Legion is not responsible for all of those who find their way to fel corruption, and those who fall on their own find themselves craving power unending, usually until their very undoing. The fel-corrupted are forever hungry for power and control, even if it should cost them their soul or the lives of their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
burning_legion_religion;Саргерит;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
burning_legion_religion_DESC;Bent on destroying all life in the universe, Sargeras is seen as one of the greatest threats to creation, and in a smaller sense, Azeroth. At his beck and call during his burning crusade across the Great Beyond is a loyal, fel-infused legion of demons, the Burning Legion, ready to carry out the destruction Sageras so very much desires. Followers of the Dark Titan are only capable of cruelty and deceit, as they chase any chance to bring about the extinguishment of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illidari;Виндикатор;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illidari_DESC;The powers of fel can be found tempting to all living beings in the universe, but there are those who use it as a tool to fight the evils that lurk throughout creation, rather than for personal gain or destruction. Though these individuals can often be found guilty of similar crimes to that of power-hungry warlocks and demons, they see any suffering inflicted as means to a greater end, an end greater than themselves and their sacrifices. Though more realistically benevolent than most demons and warlocks, society will seek to reject them and their cruel, even if effective, methods nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sethekk_worship;Сете;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anzu_worship;Анзу;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rukhmar_worship_DESC;Rukhmar is an avian sun goddess from Draenor who helped Anzu to slay Sethe. After the raven lord faded into darkness, she created the arakkoa to represent her grace and his cunning. Rukhmar fears and hates the arakkoa outcasts, for they have been cursed by Sethe. Her loyal high arakkoa followers, the adherents of Rukhmar, wage war on the cursed arakkoa in her name. The kaliri are Rukhmar's children as well, and Rukhran is rumored to be her progeny. As the mother of the arakkoa, Rukhmar was their main and traditional deity. Her veneration was eventually abandoned in favour of numerous other deities, such as Anzu, Ka'alu and Sethe, and later an unnamed Old God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethekk_worship_DESC;Sethe is a deceased primal god worshiped by, and the namesake of, the Sethekk on Draenor. He is ancient enemies with Anzu and Rukhmar, the other major deities of the arakkoa. Sethe was cold-blooded and scornful. When he flew, the winds bit his flesh. He would sun himself on the mountainsides, but he could never taste warmth. His scales were frosted glass, and his children were the wind serpents. He is the source and namesake of the Curse of Sethe, an affliction that causes any arakkoa who touches the blighted waters of Sethekk Hollow to become broken and flightless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anzu_worship_DESC;Anzu is a dread raven god deeply tied to the arakkoa and the history of the Spires of Arak. While physically Anzu was meager compared to his counterpart, Rukhmar, he possessed a great intellect. As opposed to Rukhmar loving the sun and sky, Anzu preferred the cool of the shade and the peace of the twilight hours where he could be alone in quiet contemplation. He would converse with the "gods of the abyss", and he would find them dull, witless creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

forsaken_cult_DESC;This is a group of forsaken considered heretical by most. They believe that dark energy practitioners are just as vital to the survival of life and reality as wielders of the light.

She would also create the Helarjar, a holy order to mock Odyn's Valarjar.

This happened long before the Lich King, however. The Lich King would envy the Nerubian way of organisation and the capability to spawn in mass numbers. The Lich King would later attack and swarm the kingdom with the undead. He besieged the Nerubian capital of Azjol-Nerub and, with every Nerubian dead, the undead lord would beat the numbers of the Nerub by using their fallen against them.
